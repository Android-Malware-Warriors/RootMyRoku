# This is where the magic happens.
# Normally Linux grsec prevents us from following symlinks to directories
# we don't own, but almost all of the grsec security checks fail when
# the symlink resides on an NFS mount.
# NOTE: pkg_nfs_mount requires an IP address, not a domain name.
#  The value below is the IP address that nfs.rootmyroku.com resolves to.
